## Help
Rhapsody now includes a new Help command, which makes use of individual help boxes instead of throwing everything at you at once. Type `-help` to get started. Use `-help list` to see all the commands, and use `-help <commandname>` to get help for a specific command.

## Playlists
Playlists are a new way to store your favourite tracks. We take it that you already know how playlists work, so you can get started by using `-createpl` to create a new playlist. You can add tracks using `-addtopl` and delete tracks from playlists using `-deletefrompl`. You can queue your playlists using `-addpltoqueue`. You can use `-help` for more information on these commands.

## Locks
Want to listen in peace and have no one disturb your listening session? Use `-lock` to lock Rhapsody's player and prevent others from being able to disturb your session. Use `-allow` to allow only certain users to your session, and use `-unlock` to unlock the player.

## Player Functions
Rhapsody now supports player functions like pause, resume, skip and seek. 

## Prefixes
You can now set custom prefixes with the `-setnewprefix` command.
